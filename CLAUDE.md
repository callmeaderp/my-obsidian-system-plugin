# MOC System Plugin

## Overview

This is a custom Obsidian plugin designed to automate and streamline a MOC (Map of Content) based note-taking system. The plugin focuses on efficiency by providing context-aware commands and automatic organization of notes into a hierarchical structure.

## Goals

The primary goal of this plugin is to automate the user's MOC-based system for organizing notes in Obsidian, with these specific objectives:

1. **Single-command note creation** - One keyboard shortcut handles all note creation needs based on context
2. **Dynamic content organization** - MOCs only show sections that contain content, maintaining clean and minimal structure
3. **Efficient prompt management** - Specialized system for managing LLM prompts with versioning and multi-chat link support
4. **Automated maintenance** - Auto-cleanup of broken links and automatic folder structure creation

## System Design

### File Organization Structure

- **Top-level MOCs**: Created in vault root directory with üîµ emoji prefix and "MOC" suffix
- **Sub-MOCs**: Stored in `MOCs/` folder with üîµ emoji prefix and "MOC" suffix
- **Notes**: Stored in `Notes/` folder with üìù emoji prefix  
- **Resources**: Stored in `Resources/` folder with üìÅ emoji prefix
- **Prompts**: Stored in `Prompts/` folder with ü§ñ emoji prefix (includes both hubs and iterations)

All files include frontmatter with `note-type` metadata for CSS targeting and backwards compatibility.

### MOC Structure

MOCs are identified by the `#moc` tag in their frontmatter. They start empty and dynamically display only the sections that contain content, in this fixed order:

1. MOCs (sub-MOCs)
2. Notes
3. Resources  
4. Prompts

### Prompt System

The prompt system is designed for iterative LLM conversations:

- **Prompt Hub**: Main note for a prompt topic (e.g., `AI Assistant.md`)
  - Contains links to all iterations
  - Includes `llm-links` code block for storing chat URLs
- **Iterations**: Individual versions (e.g., `AI Assistant v1.md`, `AI Assistant v2 - Added error handling.md`)
  - Can be duplicated from any version
  - Automatically increments to next available version number
  - Optional description can be added to title

## Features

### 1. Context-Aware Creation Command
**Command**: "Create MOC or add content"

- When not in a MOC: Creates a new top-level MOC
- When in a MOC: Shows modal with options to create:
  - Sub-MOC
  - Note
  - Resource
  - Prompt

### 2. Prompt Iteration Duplication
**Command**: "Duplicate prompt iteration"

- Works when viewing any prompt iteration file
- Creates copy with next version number
- Shows modal for optional description
- Updates the prompt hub automatically

### 3. Multi-Link Opening
**Command**: "Open all LLM links"

- Works when viewing a prompt hub
- Parses `llm-links` code block
- Opens all URLs in new browser tabs

### 4. Note Type Styling System
**New Feature**: Visual distinction for note types

- **Emoji Prefixes**: All created notes include type-specific emojis:
  - MOCs: üîµ (Blue circle)
  - Notes: üìù (Memo emoji)
  - Resources: üìÅ (Folder emoji)  
  - Prompts: ü§ñ (Robot emoji)

- **CSS Color Coding**: Unique colors for each note type:
  - MOCs/Groups: Blue (#2563eb) with bold styling
  - Notes: Green (#16a34a)
  - Resources: Orange (#ea580c)
  - Prompt Hubs: Dark Purple (#9333ea) with bold styling
  - Prompt Iterations: Light Purple (#c084fc) with italic styling

- **Comprehensive Styling**: Applies to:
  - File explorer entries
  - Tab titles (all tabs, not just active)
  - Active file indicators
  - Graph view nodes with size differentiation
  - Both light and dark themes

### 5. Automatic Features

- **Folder Structure**: Creates required folders on plugin load
- **Section Management**: Non-destructively adds sections to MOCs at the top, preserving existing content
- **Link Cleanup**: Removes broken links when files are deleted
- **Dynamic Styling**: Updates CSS classes based on active file and file types

## Implementation Details

### Core Architecture

The plugin extends Obsidian's Plugin class with these key components:

```typescript
export default class MOCSystemPlugin extends Plugin {
    // Main plugin class
}
```

### Key Methods

#### Content Creation Methods
- `createMOC()`: Creates top-level MOC with emoji prefix, "MOC" suffix, frontmatter tags, and note-type metadata
- `createSubMOC()`: Creates MOC in MOCs/ folder with emoji prefix, "MOC" suffix, and links from parent
- `createNote()`: Creates note in Notes/ folder with emoji prefix and links from parent MOC
- `createResource()`: Creates resource in Resources/ folder with emoji prefix and links from parent
- `createPrompt()`: Creates prompt hub and iteration with emoji prefixes, metadata, and LLM links block

#### Section Management
- `addToMOCSection()`: Non-destructively adds links to MOC sections
  - Creates section if it doesn't exist at the top (after frontmatter)
  - Maintains proper section ordering
  - Preserves any existing content below the managed sections
  - Inserts links at appropriate position within sections

#### Prompt System
- `duplicatePromptIteration()`: 
  - Parses filename to extract base name and version
  - Finds highest existing version number
  - Creates new file with incremented version
  - Updates prompt hub with new iteration link
- `updatePromptHub()`: Adds new iteration links to hub file
- `openLLMLinks()`: Extracts URLs from code block and opens in browser

#### Styling System
- `getNoteType()`: Determines note type from frontmatter metadata
- `getFileDisplayType()`: Differentiates between prompt hubs and iterations for styling
- `updateStylingClasses()`: Updates body classes based on active file for CSS targeting
- `updateFileExplorerStyling()`: Adds data attributes to file explorer items
- `updateTabStyling()`: Adds classes and data attributes to tab headers

#### Maintenance
- `cleanupBrokenLinks()`: Removes references to deleted files
- `ensureFolderStructure()`: Creates required folders if missing

### File Detection Methods
- `isMOC()`: Checks for `#moc` tag in frontmatter
- `isPromptIteration()`: Detects files with version pattern (v1, v2, etc.)
- `isPromptHub()`: Identifies prompt files that aren't iterations

### Modal Dialogs

The plugin includes several custom modals for user input:

1. **CreateMOCModal**: For creating new top-level MOCs
2. **AddToMOCModal**: Shows options when adding content to existing MOC
3. **CreateItemModal**: Generic input for creating notes/resources/etc.
4. **PromptDescriptionModal**: Optional description when duplicating prompts

### Event Handling

- Registers file deletion event to trigger automatic link cleanup
- Uses command callbacks to check active file context
- Implements keyboard shortcuts (Enter key) in all modals

## Technical Decisions

1. **Frontend-only approach**: All logic in main.ts, no settings or complex state management
2. **Tag-based MOC identification**: Uses frontmatter tags instead of naming conventions for flexibility
3. **Dynamic sections**: Sections only appear when needed, keeping MOCs clean
4. **Regex-based parsing**: For version detection and link patterns
5. **Batch link opening**: Uses window.open() in a loop for multi-link functionality

## Current Status

The plugin has been fully implemented with all requested features plus recent improvements:
- ‚úÖ Context-aware creation command
- ‚úÖ Prompt iteration system with versioning
- ‚úÖ Multi-link opening for LLM chats
- ‚úÖ Dynamic section management
- ‚úÖ Automatic link cleanup
- ‚úÖ Folder structure creation
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Emoji-prefixed note titles with type indicators and "MOC" suffix for MOCs
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Comprehensive CSS styling system with distinct colors for all note types
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Non-destructive MOC behavior (preserves existing content as "scratch pad")
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Tab title styling for all tabs (not just active files)
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Differentiated styling for prompt hubs vs iterations

The plugin has been built and tested successfully with all styling issues resolved.
